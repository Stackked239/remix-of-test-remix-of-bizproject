# BizHealth.ai Customer Language & Terminology Standards
## Critical Strategic Framework for All Content, Marketing & Development

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** January 29, 2026  
**Status:** MANDATORY for all customer-facing content  
**Scope:** All teams (Marketing, Content, Development, Sales, Product, Design)

---

## 🚨 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: THE CRITICAL FLAW

### **The Problem We're Fixing**

BizHealth.ai has been using **industry jargon ("SMB")** instead of **customer language ("small business")** across our digital presence. This creates a fundamental disconnect between how we describe our service and how our target customers search for solutions.

### **The Impact**

- **10-100x lower search volume** for "SMB" terms vs. "small business" terms
- **Poor voice search optimization** (customers don't say "I'm an SMB owner")
- **Reduced AI search visibility** (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity favor natural language)
- **Lower conversion rates** (jargon creates distance, customer language builds connection)
- **Missing 90%+ of addressable search market**

### **The Data**

| Search Term | Monthly Volume | User Type |
|-------------|----------------|-----------|
| "small business owner" | 22,200 | ✅ **End Customer** |
| "SMB owner" | ~0 | ❌ Industry Professional |
| "small business consultant" | 5,400 | ✅ **End Customer** |
| "SMB consultant" | 720 | ❌ Industry Professional |
| "small business assessment" | 880 | ✅ **End Customer** |
| "SMB assessment" | 50 | ❌ Industry Professional |

### **The Fix**

Use **"small business"** for all customer-facing content. Reserve **"SMB"** exclusively for B2B contexts (consultants, investors, industry partnerships).

---

## 📖 FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLE

### **The Golden Rule of Customer Language**

> **"Speak the language your customer uses to describe their own world, not the language you use internally to categorize them."**

Your customer thinks:
- ✅ "I'm a **small business owner** struggling with cash flow"
- ❌ NOT "I'm an **SMB** with working capital optimization challenges"

Your customer searches:
- ✅ "**small business** health check"
- ❌ NOT "**SMB** diagnostic platform"

Your customer asks AI:
- ✅ "How do I know if my **small business** is healthy?"
- ❌ NOT "What **SMB** assessment tools exist?"

---

## 📋 VOICE & TONE GUIDELINES

### **Who We Are to Our Customers**

Think of BizHealth.ai as:
- **A trusted advisor**, not a corporate vendor
- **A coach**, not a consultant
- **A partner**, not a platform provider
- **A translator**, not an analyst (we make complex simple)

### **How We Sound**

#### **✅ GOOD: Approachable Expertise**
```
"As a small business owner, you're juggling a dozen priorities every day. 
Our assessment helps you figure out what to fix first—without spending 
$10,000 on a consultant."
```

**Why this works:**
- Acknowledges their reality ("juggling a dozen priorities")
- Uses "you" and "your" (direct address)
- Speaks to pain point (expensive consultants)
- Clear benefit ("figure out what to fix first")

#### **❌ BAD: Corporate Jargon**
```
"BizHealth.ai delivers comprehensive SMB diagnostics leveraging AI-driven 
analytics to optimize operational efficiency and maximize strategic alignment 
across your enterprise."
```

**Why this fails:**
- Uses "SMB" (industry jargon)
- Too many buzzwords ("leverage," "optimize," "maximize," "strategic alignment")
- No clear customer benefit
- Sounds like it was written by a committee

---

### **Tone Attributes**

| Tone Element | Description | Example |
|--------------|-------------|---------|
| **Professional** | Credible, informed, experienced | "Based on 10,000+ assessments..." |
| **Approachable** | Friendly, not stuffy or intimidating | "Let's figure this out together" |
| **Data-driven** | Specific, quantifiable, evidence-based | "Find out exactly where..." |
| **Empowering** | Positive, possibility-focused | "Discover what's working—and what's not" |
| **Clear** | Simple language, no jargon | "Business health check" not "diagnostic platform" |
| **Direct** | Get to the point, no fluff | "90 minutes. 12 key areas. One clear report." |

---

## 🎯 SEO-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES

### **Title Tag Formula**

```
[Primary Benefit] for [Small Business/Small Business Owners] | BizHealth.ai

Examples:
✅ "Business Health Assessment for Small Business Owners | BizHealth.ai"
✅ "Affordable Business Consultant Alternative for Small Businesses"
✅ "Check Your Small Business Health in 90 Minutes | BizHealth.ai"

❌ "SMB Diagnostic Platform | BizHealth.ai"
❌ "Business Assessment Tool | BizHealth.ai" (missing "small business")
```

### **Meta Description Formula**

```
[Action verb] + [benefit] + for [small business/small business owners] + 
[differentiator] + [CTA]

Examples:
✅ "Get a comprehensive business health assessment for your small business 
    in 90 minutes. AI-powered diagnostics identify hidden problems. 
    Affordable alternative to expensive consultants. Start at $199."

✅ "Discover exactly what's holding your small business back. Our AI 
    assessment checks 12 key areas in under an hour. Used by 500+ 
    small business owners. Start your health check today."

❌ "BizHealth.ai provides SMB diagnostics using AI technology to assess 
    business performance." (jargon, no benefit, no CTA)
```

### **H1 Heading Formula**

```
[Benefit-Driven Statement] for [Small Business Owners/Small Businesses]

Examples:
✅ "Business Health Assessment Built for Small Business Owners"
✅ "Find Out What's Holding Your Small Business Back"
✅ "The Affordable Consultant Alternative for Small Businesses"

❌ "SMB Diagnostic Platform"

/affordable-business-consultant-alternative/
/small-business-growth-checklist/

❌ BAD:
/smb-diagnostics/
/business-platform/
/solutions/ (too vague)
```

#### Existing Content with "SMB" in URL:
- **If page has strong authority/backlinks:** Keep URL, update content
- **If page is new/low traffic:** Consider 301 redirect to new URL with "small-business"
- **Best practice:** Use canonical tags and update internal links

---

## 🗣️ VOICE SEARCH OPTIMIZATION

### **The Voice Search Principle**

> **"Optimize for how people speak, not how they type."**

People say:
- ✅ "How do I know if my small business is healthy?"
- ❌ NOT "small business health indicators"

### **Voice Search Question Templates**

Structure content to answer these natural questions:

```
FINANCIAL QUESTIONS:
"How do I check my small business cash flow?"
"Is my small business profitable?"
"What's a healthy profit margin for a small business?"

OPERATIONAL QUESTIONS:
"Why is my small business struggling?"
"How can I tell what's wrong with my business?"
"What should I fix first in my small business?"

GROWTH QUESTIONS:
"Is my small business ready to scale?"
"How do I know if my business can grow?"
"When should a small business hire more people?"

COMPARISON QUESTIONS:
"What's better than hiring a business consultant?"
"How much does a small business assessment cost?"
"Do I need a consultant or can I assess my business myself?"
```

### **Implementation Checklist**

For every major content piece:

- [ ] Include at least 3 natural question headings (H2/H3)
- [ ] Answer questions in conversational, complete sentences
- [ ] Use "small business" (not "SMB") in questions
- [ ] Implement FAQ Schema markup
- [ ] Keep answers under 50 words for featured snippet optimization
- [ ] Use "you" and "your" (direct address)

"Our platform leverages AI to optimize SMB performance metrics..."

## 💡 EXAMPLES: BEFORE & AFTER

### **Example 1: Homepage Hero**

#### ❌ BEFORE (Industry Jargon)
```
Headline: AI-Powered Business Intelligence for SMBs
Subheadline: Leverage cutting-edge diagnostics to optimize operational 
efficiency and maximize strategic alignment across your enterprise.
CTA: Access Platform
```

**Problems:**
- Uses "SMB"
- Jargon-heavy ("leverage," "optimize," "maximize," "strategic alignment")
- No clear benefit
- Generic CTA

#### ✅ AFTER (Customer Language)
```
Headline: Business Health Assessment for Small Business Owners
Subheadline: Find out exactly what's holding your business back—in 90 
minutes, for $199. No expensive consultants. No guesswork. Just clear 
answers and a path forward.
CTA: Check Your Business Health Now
```

**Improvements:**
- Uses "small business"
- Clear, specific language

---

### **Example 2: Blog Post**

#### ❌ BEFORE (Jargon)
```
Title: "10 KPIs Every SMB Should Track for Optimal Performance"

Opening: "In today's competitive landscape, SMBs must leverage data-driven 
insights to maximize operational efficiency. By benchmarking key performance 
indicators against industry standards, organizations can optimize their 
strategic positioning and drive sustainable growth."
```

**Problems:**
- "SMB" in title and body
- Buzzword bingo ("leverage," "maximize," "optimize," "strategic positioning")
- Abstract and corporate-sounding
- No clear audience connection

#### ✅ AFTER (Customer Language)
```
Title: "10 Numbers Every Small Business Owner Should Check Weekly"

Opening: "Running a small business means making dozens of decisions every 
day—often without enough information. These 10 metrics tell you exactly what's 
working in your business (and what needs attention). Best part? You probably 
already have the data."
```

**Improvements:**
- "Small business owner" in title
- Conversational, relatable language
- Specific benefit (know what's working/what needs attention)
- Empathetic acknowledgment of their reality

---

### **Example 3: Service Page**

#### ❌ BEFORE (Corporate/Jargon)
```
H1: Comprehensive SMB Diagnostic Platform

Body: "BizHealth.ai delivers end-to-end business intelligence solutions 
for SMBs seeking to optimize performance across all operational verticals. 
Our proprietary AI-powered assessment framework leverages advanced analytics 
to provide actionable insights that drive ROI and maximize value creation."

CTA: Learn More
```

**Problems:**
- "SMB" throughout
- Corporate jargon overload
- Vague benefits
- Weak CTA

#### ✅ AFTER (Clear, Benefit-Driven)
```
H1: Complete Business Health Assessment for Small Business Owners

Body: "Get a comprehensive health check of your small business in just 90 
minutes. Our AI assessment examines 12 critical areas—from cash flow to 
operations to team structure—and shows you exactly what to fix first. 
It's like a consultant's analysis, but faster, more affordable, and 
completely unbiased."

CTA: Start Your Assessment ($199)
```

**Improvements:**
- "Small business" in H1 and body
- Clear, specific process (90 minutes, 12 areas)
- Tangible comparison (like a consultant)
- Specific, price-inclusive CTA

---

### **Example 4: Email Campaign**

#### ❌ BEFORE (B2B/Jargon)
```
Subject: Optimize Your SMB Operations with AI-Powered Analytics

Body:
"Dear Business Leader,

In today's fast-paced business environment, SMBs face increasing pressure 
to optimize operational efficiency while maximizing resource allocation. 
Our comprehensive diagnostic platform leverages cutting-edge AI technology 
to deliver actionable insights that drive measurable ROI.

Click here to access our platform."
```

**Problems:**
- "SMB" in subject and body
- Formal/distant tone ("Dear Business Leader")
- Buzzwords throughout
- No specific benefit or urgency

#### ✅ AFTER (Relatable, Conversational)
```
Subject: Is your small business as healthy as it could be?

Body:
"Hi [First Name],

Quick question: When's the last time you did a comprehensive health check 
of your business?

Most small business owners we talk to can point to what's going well—but 
struggle to identify what's quietly holding them back. Cash flow issues 
that don't show up until it's too late. Team structure problems that slow 
everything down. Strategy gaps that keep you stuck.

Our 90-minute assessment finds these hidden problems—so you can fix them 
before they become crises.

[Check Your Small Business Health]

It's $199 for a complete diagnostic. No ongoing fees. No sales calls. 
Just clear answers about what to fix first."

## 📞 QUESTIONS & ENFORCEMENT

### **Have Questions?**

If you're unsure whether to use "small business" or "SMB" in a specific context:

1. **Ask yourself:** "Is this for a business owner or about business owners?"
   - For = small business
   - About = SMB acceptable

2. **Read it aloud:** Would a small business owner say this?
   - Yes = good language
   - No = rewrite

3. **When still unsure:** Default to "small business"

### **This is Mandatory**

This is not a style preference—it's a strategic imperative that affects:
- SEO performance (10x difference in search volume)
- Conversion rates (customer language resonates better)
- Brand perception (accessible vs. corporate)
- Market reach (90%+ of customers use "small business")

**All new content must comply with this guide before publication.**

**Existing content will be systematically updated according to the migration plan.**

## 🏁 FINAL REMINDERS

### **The Three Core Principles**

1. **Speak like your customer speaks** → Use "small business," not "SMB"
2. **Benefits over features** → What they get, not what we do
3. **Clear over clever** → Simple language wins

### **The One-Sentence Test**

Before publishing anything, ask:

> **"Would a small business owner struggling with cash flow understand this immediately and know why it matters to them?"**

If the answer is no, rewrite it.
