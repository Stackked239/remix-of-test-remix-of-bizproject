            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              You can't fly over the runway and cut throttle, hoping the plane lands safely. That's not how aviation works. And it's not how business exits work either.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              A successful landing depends on the <strong>final approach</strong>—the deliberate, methodical preparation that happens long before the wheels touch down. The approach determines altitude, speed, angle, and alignment. Everything must be precisely calibrated. If the approach is wrong, no amount of desperate maneuvering during landing will fix it.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed font-semibold">
              A sudden exit is like a sudden landing. It rarely ends well.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Most business owners treat exit like an unexpected event that will be figured out when it happens. When health issues emerge, a retirement deadline arrives, or an unexpected buyer appears, they scramble to prepare. The result is what economists call a "distressed sale"—a transaction driven by urgency rather than strategy. And distressed sales are notorious for delivering significantly lower valuations than methodically prepared exits.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The difference between owners who maximize exit value and those who leave millions on the table isn't luck. It's preparation. Years of it.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Here's the misconception that costs small business owners the most money: the belief that strong financials equal maximum exit value.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              You have a profitable business. Your balance sheet looks good. Revenue is growing. Profit margins are solid. You assume that when a buyer comes along, they'll see these impressive numbers and offer top dollar.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              This is where most owners get blindsided.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              <strong>A buyer is not purchasing your financial statements. They're purchasing a business that can generate those financials without you running it.</strong>
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              This is the critical difference. Your financials prove what your business <em>has done</em>. A sophisticated buyer cares about what it <em>will do</em>—under new leadership, without your relationships, without your decision-making, without your presence.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              This is why a buyer will "test fly" your business far more thoroughly than reviewing your financial statements. They're evaluating:

            <ol className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
              <li>
                <strong>Can this operation run without the founder?</strong> If the answer is no, your business is dependent on you personally. That creates massive risk for a buyer. They're not purchasing a business—they're purchasing a job. And jobs are worth significantly less than businesses that run themselves.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Are revenues real and repeatable?</strong> Or are they dependent on your relationships and personal reputation? Can your team execute the same quality of work? Are customer relationships documented and transferable?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Are processes documented and executable?</strong> Or does everything live in your head? Can a new manager step in and operate without constantly asking you for context?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Is the management team capable of running this without you?</strong> Do you have a documented organizational structure? Can second-level managers lead? Will they stay under new ownership?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Is the cost structure sustainable?</strong> Or are you running at margins that only make sense because you're not paying yourself a market salary? Once a new owner has to staff properly, do the financials still work?
              </li>
            </ol>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              These questions can't be answered by looking at a profit-and-loss statement. They require deep evaluation of operations, systems, people, and structure. This is what buyers actually assess during <Link to="/blog/business-strategy" className="text-biz-green hover:underline">due diligence</Link>. And if the answers reveal that your business is dependent on you, your valuation will be discounted significantly—sometimes by 30%, 40%, or even more.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              When a buyer moves into due diligence, they're not confirming what they already believe about your business. They're testing it. Aggressively.
            </p>
            
            <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-foreground mt-8 mb-4">A sophisticated buyer will investigate:</h3>

                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Are your numbers accurate? Do your financial statements reflect normalized operations? Are there hidden liabilities? Is revenue recognized appropriately? Have you been consistent with accounting policies? The buyer will engage their own accountant to scrutinize everything. If there are inconsistencies or unclear items, they signal incompetence at best, dishonesty at worst. Either way, valuations get discounted.
                </p>
              </div>

                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Is revenue real? Is it sustainable without specific customers, relationships, or market conditions? Can the revenue be verified through customer contracts? Are there long-term agreements, or is revenue dependent on renewal each year? High customer concentration (one or few customers representing large percentages of revenue) is a massive red flag that typically results in valuation discounts.
                </p>

                  Can the business actually operate without you? Can existing managers run it? Is there documented succession planning? Will key employees stay? Can processes be taught to others, or do they exist only in your head? If operations are dependent on the founder, expect significant discounts.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Is the buyer aware of risks, or will they discover them during diligence? Known risks can be priced in. Unknown risks are discovered during diligence and often result in deal delays, renegotiations, or terminated deals. Transparent risk disclosure builds trust. Hidden risks destroy it.

                <p className="text-muted-foreground">
                  Are growth projections realistic? Are they based on documented market data or hopeful thinking? Can the buyer defend these projections to their board/investors? Unrealistic forecasts create buyer skepticism about all your assumptions.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">The Case for Starting Your Final Approach 3-5 Years Before Exit</h2>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The biggest mistake business owners make is starting exit preparation too close to the actual sale. They give themselves 6-12 months to fix problems that actually require 2-3 years to address properly.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed font-semibold">
              Here's why early preparation changes everything:
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-biz-green/10 border border-biz-green/20 rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
              <h4 className="text-xl font-semibold text-foreground mb-4">Benefits of Starting Early</h4>
              <ul className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
                <li>
                  <strong>You can address operational dependencies gradually.</strong> If your business is dependent on you, you can't fix that in six months. But over three years, you can systematically document processes, train managers, delegate decision-making, and build the organizational structure needed to run without you. Buyers will see that the organization is maturing—not just that you're preparing to exit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Financial consistency becomes visible.</strong> If you spend the last year cleaning up financials, it looks like you're optimizing for sale (which is fine, but buyers notice). If you've been consistently maintaining clean, normalized financial statements for three years, it proves that's how you actually operate.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Issues can be addressed proactively.</strong> You find problems with customer concentration, management gaps, or <Link to="/blog/operations" className="text-biz-green hover:underline">process documentation</Link>. Instead of scrambling to fix them before due diligence, you have time to address them methodically. You might even increase valuation by 15-25% through operational improvements over the preparation period.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>You maintain control.</strong> A business owner who prepares three years in advance is driving the exit strategy. A business owner who prepares six months before is being driven by circumstances. Early preparation means you decide when to sell, to whom, and under what conditions. Late preparation means you're taking whatever offer appears.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Market timing improves.</strong> You're not forced to sell in a down market. You can wait for favorable conditions. You have flexibility.
                </li>
              </ul>

            {/* What Buyers Test */}
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">What Buyers Are Really Testing</h2>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              When due diligence begins, buyers are running a comprehensive evaluation. Here's what they're checking:
            </p>
            
            <ul className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground my-6">
              <li>
                <strong>Financial accuracy and sustainability.</strong> Can revenue be verified? Can profit margins be sustained? Are the accounting statements accurate? Will the business generate the same results under new ownership?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Customer relationships and contracts.</strong> Are customer relationships transferable, or are they dependent on you? Do contracts extend beyond your tenure? What's the customer churn rate? How concentrated is revenue among few customers?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Employee capability and retention.</strong> Can the team execute without you? Are key people documented and staying? Is compensation competitive so they won't leave post-acquisition? Is there a succession plan?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Operational systems and documentation.</strong> Can a new manager run the business by following documented processes? Or does everything require your direction? The more systematized, the lower the risk.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Legal compliance and issues.</strong> Are there pending lawsuits? Tax problems? Regulatory violations? Compliance gaps? These all affect valuation and deal timing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Asset condition and infrastructure.</strong> Are physical assets well-maintained? Is <Link to="/blog/technology" className="text-biz-green hover:underline">technology infrastructure</Link> adequate for growth? Will post-acquisition CapEx be required?
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Competitive position and sustainability.</strong> Is the business defensible? Can it sustain competitive advantage without you? What's the barrier to entry for competitors?
              </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Every one of these areas impacts valuation. If your preparation has been solid, due diligence becomes confirmation rather than investigation. If preparation has been weak, due diligence becomes discovery of problems—and problems mean discounts.
            </p>

            {/* Numbers That Matter */}
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">The Numbers That Matter in Exit Preparation</h2>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              You should understand how exit preparation impacts valuation. Here's what the research shows:
            </p>
            
            <div className="bg-card border-l-4 border-biz-green rounded-lg p-6 my-8">
              <ul className="space-y-4 text-muted-foreground">
                <li>
                  <strong>Businesses with strong exit preparation typically achieve 20-30% higher valuations</strong> than unprepared businesses in the same industry and financial position.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The difference isn't always in financials. It's in operational clarity, risk reduction, and buyer confidence. A buyer pays more for a business they understand and trust than for a business where due diligence uncovers surprises.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Owner dependency discounts are real.</strong> A business heavily dependent on the founder can see valuations discounted by 30-50%. Reducing owner dependency systematically over 2-3 years can increase valuation by 30-50%. That's millions of dollars in difference.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Customer concentration discounts are also significant.</strong> A business where one customer represents 40% of revenue might be discounted 25-35% relative to the same business with diversified customers.
                </li>
              </ul>

              This isn't an accident. Businesses that have been methodically prepared for 3+ years sell faster, at higher valuations, with fewer surprises. Businesses that scramble for 6 months before reaching out to buyers have a dramatically harder time.

            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">The Strategic Advantage: You're Not Desperate</h2>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              A business owner who has spent three years preparing for exit has an enormous advantage: <strong>They don't need to sell right now.</strong> They can wait for favorable conditions. They can be selective about buyers. They can walk away from bad deals. They're negotiating from strength.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              A business owner who prepares six months before exit is essentially negotiating from desperation. They need the deal to close. Buyers sense this. Valuations reflect it.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed font-semibold text-lg">
              Early preparation buys you flexibility, control, and leverage. That's worth real money.
            </p>

            {/* Taking the First Step */}
            <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-foreground mt-12 mb-6">Taking the First Step</h2>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              If you're years away from exit, the first step is simple: <strong>Get a professional business valuation.</strong> Not to establish a price—to establish a baseline and understand what drives your value.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              Use that valuation as a strategic planning tool. What would increase it? What creates risk? What needs to improve? Now you have a roadmap for the next 3-5 years of exit preparation.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              If you're closer to exit, the work is more intensive. You need to understand what a buyer will see during due diligence. Tools like <Link to="/how-it-works" className="text-biz-green hover:underline font-semibold">BizHealth.ai</Link> can help conduct a comprehensive assessment of your business across 12 critical areas—<Link to="/blog/financial-management" className="text-biz-green hover:underline">financial health</Link>, operational maturity, customer concentration, management capability, technology infrastructure, and more. This assessment reveals exactly what a buyer will discover during due diligence, and it gives you time to address issues before a real buyer sees them.
            </p>
            
            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              An exit-readiness assessment takes the place of a buyer doing their own discovery—you find the problems first, while you still have time to fix them.
            </p>

              <p className="text-foreground font-semibold text-lg">
                The business owners who maximize exit value aren't the ones with the biggest businesses or the best financials. They're the ones who understood that exit value is created through methodical preparation, not through last-minute scrambling.
              </p>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed text-lg font-semibold">
              Your final approach determines your landing value. The preparation happens years before the transaction closes.

              <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
                A successful business exit isn't determined by the sale process itself—it's determined by how well you prepare for it. Start now, prepare methodically, and you'll have control when the time comes to sell. Wait until the last minute, and you'll be fortunate if you get an acceptable offer, let alone top dollar for your life's work.
